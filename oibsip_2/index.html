                    <b>Walter Elias Disney</b>,was an American animator, film producer, voice actor, and entrepreneur. A pioneer of the American animation industry, he introduced several developments in the production of cartoons.<br><br>
                    As a film producer, he holds the record for most Academy Awards earned<br>and nominations by an individual. He was presented with two Golden<br>Globe Special Achievement Awards and an Emmy Award, among other<br>honors. Several of his films are included in the National Film Registry by<br>the Library of Congress and have also been named as some of the<br>greatest films ever by the American Film Institute.<br><br>
                    To replace Oswald, Disney and Iwerks developed Mickey Mouse, possibly inspired by a pet mouse that Disney had adopted while working in his<br>Laugh-O-Gram studio, although the origins of the character are unclear.

                        Born in Chicago in 1901, Disney developed an early interest in drawing. He took art classes as a boy and took a job as a commercial illustrator at the age of 18.<br><br>
                        He moved to California in the early 1920s and set up the Disney Brothers Studio (Now "The Walt Disney Company") with his brother Roy.<br><br>
                        After the success of Mickey Mouse,  he became more adventurous, introducing synchronized sound, full-color three-strip Technicolor, feature-length cartoons and technical developments in cameras.New animated and live-action films followed after World War II.
